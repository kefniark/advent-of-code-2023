# Advent of Code 2023

![](./advent-logo.jpg)

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I use this event as an opportunity to write some **[Golang](https://go.dev/)**, I'm a bit rusted and I haven't used it for a while ^^

## Days

* [Day 1 : Calibration](./day1/main.go)
* [Day 2 : Cube Conundrum](./day2/main.go) ([v2](./day2/main_v2.go))
* Day 3 : Soon

## Run

```sh
cd day2/ # or any other day
go run main.go
```

Each day is a self contain folder with vanilla Golang, no extra tooling, scripts or dependencies

## Caution

Please don't use these answers as a way to cheat, those are puzzle made for entertainment.

To quote the official FAQ:

> Please try to avoid giving away the solution while people are competing. If a puzzle's global daily leaderboard isn't full yet and you're likely to get points, please wait to stream/post your solution until after that leaderboard is full.
